				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>Everything started for me to enter the computer language one day, we learned html in class that day, then css, then javascript, finally python, I repeated them nicely. It took me 6 months to learn them, then I started to think, I wonder if I should start making websites? one day i made my decision i was going to do it and as you can see i did At that time, I was 8 years old, of course, I asked my teacher who taught me, after I made the website, I shared some places on the internet. Now, various people from around the world visit the website</p>
